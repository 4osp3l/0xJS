# 0xJS v4.0
0xJS is a AI-powered command-line tool that scans JavaScript files for sensitive information. It can identify API keys, credentials, tokens, and other medium to critical severity secrets with high accuracy ( also scans for potential security issues in JS ). It supports URLs/endpoints extraction, as well as minified-JS analysis.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Gemini API key

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4osp3l/0xJS
cd 0xJS
```

# Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -q -U google-genai
pip install python-dotenv
pip install requests
```

# Set up environment

```bash
touch .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

# Quick Start ( One-Liner )
```bash
git clone https://github.com/4osp3l/0xJS.git && cd 0xJS && python main.py
```

# Usage

usage: scanner.py [-h] --mode {sensitive,endpoints,security,config} [--url URL] [--file FILE] [--key KEY]

AI-Powered JavaScript Security Tool v3.0

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  --mode {sensitive,endpoints,security,config}
                        Scan mode (required)
  --url URL            Single URL to scan
  --file FILE          File containing list of URLs to scan (one per line)
  --key KEY            Configure API key (required for config mode)
```

> Configure API Key
```bash
python main.py --mode config --key "AIzaSyYourActualAPIKeyHere"
```
> Mode ( Sensitive Information Scan )
```bash
# Single URL
python main.py --mode sensitive --url "https://example.com/app.js"

# Multiple URLs from file
python main.py --mode sensitive --file "urls.txt"
```
> URLs/Endpoints Extraction
```bash
# Single URL
python main.py --mode endpoints --url "https://example.com/app.js"

# Multiple URLs from file
python main.py --mode endpoints --file "urls.txt"
```
> Security Vulnerability Scan
```bash
# Single URL
python main.py --mode security --url "https://example.com/app.js"

# Multiple URLs from file
python main.py --mode security --file "urls.txt"
```

# Limitations
- Maximum file size - 800,000 characters per JavaScript file
- Larger files should be split using the ./chunk.py utility ( host locally and try again ).
- Requires active internet connection for API calls
- API rate limits apply based on your Gemini plan
